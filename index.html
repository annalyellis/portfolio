    <p>Hello! I'm Annaly, a second-year Data Science student at UC San Diego with a specialization in machine learning and artificial intelligence. My education has equipped me with skills in programming, statistical methods, and more. Outside of academics, I enjoy surfing, climbing, and skiing. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my technical background to solve practical problems. 
    </p>
